# Goal tracking application

## Intro

I am an ambitious person. I love to have goals and even more achieving them. That is why I made this application to keep track of my short-term or/and long-term goals. It is not a complex application, but sure it is an interesting one. User can do things like

- See all their goals achieved or not
- Add goal
- Remove goal
- Mark unachieved goal as achieved and celebrate it
- Change their profile settings
- Change their account settings

## Technology stack:

1. React (Nextjs)
2. Nestjs (Nestjs/schedule)
3. MongoDb
4. Github actions
